Now, let's convert this binary string to ascii characters:

```python
>>> a = "01100110 01100101 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100000 00100000 01100000 01100000 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101000 00100000 01100000 01100000 01100100 00100000 01100010 01100001 00100000 01100000 01011111 01101000 00100000 01101000 01100110 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100110 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100000 00100000 01100010 01100001 00100000 01100000 01100000 01100101 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100011 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100100 00100000 01100000 01100000 01100100 00100000 01100010 01100001 00100000 01101000 01100110 00100000 01100010 01100001 00100000 01101000 01100111 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100100 00100000 01100000 01100000 01100101 00100000 01100010 01100001 00100000 01100000 01100000 01100101 00100000 01100000 01100000 01100011 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100100 00100000 01101000 01101000 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100110 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100100 00100000 01100000 01011111 01100000 00100000 01100000 01100000 01100011 00100000 01100011 01100101 00100000 01100011 01100101 00100000 01100011 01100101"
>>> ''.join([chr(int(i,2)) for i in a.split(' ')])
'fe `_` ``e bh ``d ba `_h hf `_f `_` ba ``e `_c `_d ``d ba hf ba hg `_d ``e ba ``e ``c `_d hh `_f `_d `_` ``c ce ce ce'
```

Looks like ROT47:
~~~
$ echo 'fe `_` ``e bh ``d ba `_h hf `_f `_` ba ``e `_c `_d ``d ba hf ba hg `_d ``e ba ``e ``c `_d hh `_f `_d `_` ``c ce ce ce' | tr '\!-~' 'P-~\!-O'
76 101 116 39 115 32 109 97 107 101 32 116 104 105 115 32 97 32 98 105 116 32 116 114 105 99 107 105 101 114 46 46 46
~~~

Now looks like ASCII:

```python
>>> a = "76 101 116 39 115 32 109 97 107 101 32 116 104 105 115 32 97 32 98 105 116 32 116 114 105 99 107 105 101 114 46 46 46"
>>> ''.join(chr(int(i)) for i in a.split(' '))
"Let's make this a bit trickier..."
```

# [Task 2] Hashes 28/05/2019
## Description

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hashcodes, digests, or simply hashes. Crack the following hashes to reveal the answers. Hashcat  bruteforce is probably the easiest way to complete this challenge, or try [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and [md5hasing.net](https://md5hashing.net/) if you want to go easy-mode.

# [Task 3] Spectrograms 28/05/2019

## Description

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.
